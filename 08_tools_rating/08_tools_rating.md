Tools (Rate yourself 1 to 5)

-   Git (4)
    In my last job I only used BitBucket for 1 year on and off and mostly we use trunk based repository. So I can but not the most confident.

-   Redis (4)
    I used core framework specific caching library, considering the load is small (I handled internal systems for manufacturing company), But I understand the concept of caching and I'm confident that I can learn redis rather quickly.

-   VSCode (4.5)
    I used It daily for the last years, My knowledge is limited but for coding, debugging, testing. I can use it pretty well.

-   Linux (3)
    I used it only for my side projects, My knowledge again limited because I never in a place responsible to handle a server, My positions prior to this moment is fullstack developer that not touch deployment that much

-   AWS (2)

    -   EC2 (2)
    -   Lambda (2)
    -   RDS (2)
    -   Cloudwatch (2)
    -   S3 (3)

    Overall for AWS skill is lacking. I only worked with metal personal server and also I responsible mostly for fullstack development from SQL query to frontend.
    But again, It's just familiarity issue, I can learn it rather efficiently.

-   Unit testing (4)
    I did lots of manual testing and documentation in the past, and for automated unit testing I'm quite confident with my ability.

-   Kanban boards (5)
    I'm familiar with productivity tools such as kanban boards considering I'm also an Industrial Engineer.
